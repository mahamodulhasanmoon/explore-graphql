GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data

its not any database it is a programming language to get data 

graphql is make a layer between  frontend and backend


and client who use the query languages to use get data from the api

graphql is existing between frontend and backend

in ql word you have to remembered that it is a database like sql but it is not a database. but it is a query api not a database


graphql is maintained 2 type of request 

1 query
2 mutation


when we fetch data it called query and other requested are mutations

query is like as a get request


mutations is different and weard . provably a coneept as like as hand link data and its related to changees in data its like as post , put and delete requests.


but when you use graphql you dont need to thing about the process of request and as a confused there was a leyer between frontend and backend


there is two way usigng graphql when it developed  it be a complete different service in frontend and backend make a request trough backend service or it can exits as a backend service


but if yous fronted you naver make a request end poient like backend because it is always comunicate with graphql 




different between graphql and only api

REST API :

one end point 
overfetching and underfetching 



graphql :

single endpoint
