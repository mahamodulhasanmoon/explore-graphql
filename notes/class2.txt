there is 5 types of data in graphql 

1. ID
2. String
3.Float
4.int
5. Boolean

// for the queryis you need to define type of your data as like as 

type User {
  id : ID,
  name: string,
  age: Int,
  height : Float,
  isMarried: Boolean,
}

its very very strictly type 

if you need to require this data you need to use ! mark but it optional you can remove this sign


// every graphql api need to a scema 
it is not connected to database
